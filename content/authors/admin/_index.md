Hi, I'm a data scientist with a solid educational foundation in statistics and computer science from the University of Waterloo, Canada. My expertise centers on solving data science challenges, predominantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), across diverse industries, including finance, cybersecurity, and commercial domain names.

I have a proven track record in building end-to-end, high-performance machine learning and deep learning services, ensuring their seamless scalability and robust high availability on cloud platforms.

I'm deeply passionate about statistical/machine learning, deep learning (particularly in the context of NLP and Reinforcement Learning), and software/data engineering.
